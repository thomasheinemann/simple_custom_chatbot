    "This project is about customizing a chatbot, which is based on the GPT3-Turbo model. The main idea of this project is suggested by udacity in the framework of a generative AI online course. The custom design is realized by providing context information to this model with each question the user asks the chatbot.\n",
    "Our context we whish to provide the chatbot consists in a list of character descriptions from theater, television, and film productions. Each row of this list contains the name, description, medium, and setting. The list is made available by udacity and all characters were invented by an OpenAI model.\n",
    "The idea of choosing a character dataset for customizing a chatbot is to study a model bias towards names and how this can be influenced by external sources.\n",
    "For this purpose, we consider asking the chatbot about a likely personality and appearance of persons possessing certain names and repeat asking the chatbot the same question while providing context information about character descriptions."
